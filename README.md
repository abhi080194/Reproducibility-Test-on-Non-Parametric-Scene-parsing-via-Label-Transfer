Computational Reproducibility Project
Checked if and to what extent the above research paper is reproducible.
Dealt with challenges like getting the same system configuration, software versions etc. to run the experiment.
The project survey consists of multiple papers which I shortlisted to check for Reproducibility.
The report consist of the paper I reproduced and compares the results I obtained Vs. the results obtained by the author of the paper.
